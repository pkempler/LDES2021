## README
This page contains the model code and input parameters used to produce the original manuscript figures for ""Research priorities for seasonal energy storage using electrolyzers and fuel cells" published in Joule in January of 2022. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2021.12.020

The publicly available code was written by Paul A. Kempler with feedback from John J. Slack and Andrew M. Baker. The code is provided as a series of Jupyter Notebooks corresponding to Figures 1 (notebooks "ElectricityStack...", "VoltageStack...", and "DurabilityStack...") and Figure 2 (notebooks "FuelCell_...") in the main text. Details on the sources for modeling assumptions are available both within the publicly available supplemental information (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2021.12.020) and commented throughout the notebooks.

These notebooks can be readily modified to model the levelized cost of hydrogen produced by a projected electrolyzer stack performance and cost or similarly the levelized cost of electricity for a projected fuel cell stack performance and cost. They are more specifically designed to make comparisons between two modeling parameters (e.g. the price of electricity and the operating voltage of a single cell) to deterimine the relative influence on the price of hydrogen produced by an electrolysis plant based on the technology.

Please contact pkempler[at]uoregon[dot]edu with questions about model assumptions or implementing the code for your own purposes.
